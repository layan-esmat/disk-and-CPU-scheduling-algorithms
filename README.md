# Disk and CPU Scheduling Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project explores and implements fundamental **disk scheduling** and **CPU scheduling algorithms** used by operating systems to manage hardware resources efficiently. The goal is to analyze how different scheduling strategies affect system performance, seek time, and CPU utilization.

## Objectives
- Implement common disk and CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Compare algorithm performance based on total seek time, waiting time, and turnaround time.
- Understand trade-offs between fairness, efficiency, and response time.

## Disk Scheduling Algorithms
The project includes implementations of:
- **FCFS (First Come First Served)**
- **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
- **SCAN**
- **C-SCAN**
- **LOOK**
- **C-LOOK**

These algorithms optimize disk head movement to reduce seek time and improve I/O performance.

## CPU Scheduling Algorithms
The CPU scheduling component covers:
- **FCFS (First Come First Served)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Round Robin**

Each algorithm is evaluated using standard scheduling metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C / C++ (or specify your language)
- Development Environment: Standard console-based execution

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of scheduling mechanisms in operating systems.
- Ability to analyze algorithm efficiency under different workloads.
- Improved knowledge of low-level system performance optimization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how scheduling decisions directly impact system responsiveness and efficiency. By comparing multiple algorithms, the strengths and limitations of each approach become evident in different operating scenarios.
